# AeroGuard

A blockchain-powered platform for enhancing transparency, traceability, and security in aerospace and defense supply chains, combating counterfeit parts and ensuring compliance with regulatory standards — all on-chain using Clarity.

---

## Overview

AeroGuard consists of four main smart contracts that together form a decentralized, tamper-proof ecosystem for aerospace and defense stakeholders, including manufacturers, suppliers, maintainers, and regulators:

1. **Parts Registry Contract** – Registers and certifies aerospace parts with immutable metadata.
2. **Supply Chain Tracking Contract** – Tracks ownership transfers, logistics, and provenance throughout the supply chain.
3. **Maintenance Log Contract** – Records and verifies maintenance events and inspections for aircraft and defense equipment.
4. **Compliance Governance Contract** – Manages regulatory compliance voting and updates to standards.

## Features

- **Immutable parts certification** to prevent counterfeits  
- **Real-time supply chain traceability** from manufacturer to end-user  
- **Tamper-proof maintenance records** for safety and auditability  
- **Decentralized governance** for industry standards and compliance updates  
- **Oracle integration** for off-chain data like shipment verifications  
- **Token-based incentives** for verified suppliers and maintainers  
- **Secure data sharing** between authorized parties without central intermediaries

## Smart Contracts

### Parts Registry Contract
- Register new parts with unique IDs, metadata (e.g., serial numbers, materials, certifications)
- Mint NFTs representing certified parts for ownership proof
- Query and verify part authenticity on-chain

### Supply Chain Tracking Contract
- Record transfers of ownership and custody (e.g., from supplier to assembler)
- Enforce rules for valid handoffs with multi-signature approvals
- Generate provenance reports for audits

### Maintenance Log Contract
- Log maintenance events, inspections, and repairs with timestamps and signatures
- Integrate with oracles for real-world verification (e.g., sensor data)
- Automate alerts for overdue maintenance based on usage thresholds

### Compliance Governance Contract
- Token-weighted voting for updating compliance standards or blacklisting suppliers
- On-chain proposal submission and execution
- Quorum management for industry-wide decisions
